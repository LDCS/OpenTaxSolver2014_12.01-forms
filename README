This is a version of OTS which will download and fill out the forms
for you. Mainly for the command line people, but who else uses OTS
anyway?

You use it the same way that you use the normal OTS. The OTS tools now
emit .xfdf files, these can be used by pdftk to fill in the government
supplied PDF files. Inside the README for the US and state example
directory there is a command which can be run which will download the
proper forms and fill them out using pdftk.

This version if experimental, and I would love to get some feedback if
people find issues.
