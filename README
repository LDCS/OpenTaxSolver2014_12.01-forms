This is a version of OTS which will download and fill out the forms
for you. Mainly form the command line people , but who else uses OTS
anyway ?

You use it the same way that you use the normal OTS, but inside the
README for the US and state example directory there is a command which
can be run which will download the proper forms and fill them out using
pdftk. 

This version if experimental, and I would love to get some feedback if
people find issues.
